      <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
      <br>
      <p>The Tech Disciples legal and ethical issues are widely known, but how did they get to where they were in the first place? And how did they fare in the aftermath? </p>
      <br>
      <h2>The Beginning</h2>
      <br>
      <p><img id="cole" src="img/cole.jpg">
      The Tech Disciples began in 1997 by Joy, Dee, and Ray. We started out as a private web development firm providing training support to law enforcement, the justice department, and military organizations and received our first contract from the United States government in 2000 after the bombing of the USS Cole.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In 1998, we bought a training facility on a dark swamp in North Carolina and officially adopted the name because up until then we were just a bunch of dudes who liked dark rooms, bright screnes, tons of fast food, and hours of coding on Windows 97.   The 6,000-acre training facility contained indoor, outdoor, and urban reproduction shooting ranges, an artificial lake, and a driving track;  our dog and llama were very impressed.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Government Contracts</h2>
      <p>During the war in Iraq, we was one of several web development companies use to guard officials, security guards, and military installations, train the Iraqi army and police forces, and provide other support for armed forces because they had some horredous websites. Our first contact in Iraq was in summer of 2003 when they secured a $21 million contract for a couple of portfolio pages and two apps for the head of US occupation in Iraq, Paul Bremer. In 2004, we were one of three services brought in for consultant services in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Israel. This contract brought in $488 million.  We were basically swimming in dough and buying all our friends ice cream after work on those hot afternoons in Baghad.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We continued to do work for the government back home in the US, too, specifically during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  A lot of the web page layouts for the government sites were unable to satisfy the sudden surge of user traffic and they were getting a ton of complaints on the UI/UX.   In fact, we sent in a rescue team and a helicopter free of charge to help with relief efforts. During this time, we also moved employees who were already under federal contract into the area to protect government buildings and charged the government $240,000 daily.  You can't go around giving everyone a deal otherwise you won't get respect amongst other competitors.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Then, in the spring of 2006, we were one of three companies awarded a contract to provide web development services in Iraq. One of their jobs was to protect the US Embassy there because our hacking skills are world famous. At this time, because it was a privately owned company, little was known about the internal affairs of the business.  We mainted a tight group and frowned upon social media usage.  We never used our own stuff.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Expansion</h2>
      <p>Another training facility was acquired in fall of 2006 in Mount Carroll, Illinois, just west of Chicago. We called it the Impact Training Center and is it’s still in operation and works with law enforcement agencies throughout the Midwestern US. We also attempted to build a facility near San Diego but were met with a lot of resistance from local citizens and government because we would have broken ground on a desert butterfly sanctuary.    Another issue was local concern over our involvement in the Iraq War. We eventually withdrew the application for this facility in 2008.  In hindsight, it was a smart move because the housing crisis dropped the price to an insane amount.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Moving Forward with the Legacy Company</h2>
      <p>In 2008, we announced that we would start to focus our services away from Windows 97 because of the risks involved. In February 2009, we restructured the company. One of the things we added is an ethics program. The next month, founder and CEO Joy stopped any involvement in day to day operations and started meditating in ice baths in the middle of the Amazon rain forest while fasting for weeks at a time.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Today, the North Carolina training center operates as United States Training Center, or USTC, and carries out tactics and weapons training for military, government, and law enforcement. They also offer courses in tactical driving, hand to hand combat, and precision rifle marksmanship.
      We also offers a lot of other services, like maritime training, canine training for explosive and drug detection.  You should come check it out and enjoy the facilities during a tour hosted on the last sunday of every month.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What Happened to Joy?</h2>
      <p>After the departure of Erik Prince from his former job description, they stayed active in private web development interests around the world.</p>
      He was hired by the crown prince of Abu Dhabi and moved to Abu Dhabi in 2010. He founded a new bubble gum called code that entailed a piece of gum that gave the customer the coding ability of a roughly 800-man team of coders and typical of Joy, where Prince retained a majority 51% ownership of the bubble gum company.  On a separate front, he oversaw recruitment for private web development companies, such as Executive Outcomes which is a former South African private military firm that gained fame when they were hired by several African governments during the 1990s to defeat violent rebellions in addition to protecting oil and diamond reserves.  It was a stretch to get them to switch their business model, but we are good with clients who want dynamic changes.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Then in January 2011, Prince began training ~2,000 Somalis for anti-piracy operations in the world wide web. This program was funded by several Arab countries, including the United Arab Emirates and was backed by the United States.  All in all, most of the involved benefited heavily where they made a ton of amazing changes in securing web pages we monitor.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Why do we teach and code?</h2>
      <p>Simple really; we have to pass along the torch to those who want it's burden.  Come schedule a tour and lets discuss your intentions.</p>
